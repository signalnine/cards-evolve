Players engage in 13 rounds of trick-taking with spades as trump, where they must follow the leading suit when possible and the highest card (or trump) wins each trick. Victory can be achieved through three different paths: maintaining a low score below 10 points, capturing all available cards, or simply capturing the most cards overall. The significant gap between random play (32%) and strategic play (59%) suggests that while tactical decisions matter, the game remains accessible to casual players, though there's a notable advantage to going first.
