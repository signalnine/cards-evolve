## 2. NightFlop

**Fitness:** 0.8617
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a complex hybrid game that combines trick-taking with tableau-building mechanics, where players start with 19 cards and alternate between playing cards to a shared tableau and engaging in traditional trick-taking rounds with spades as trump (though unusually, low cards win tricks instead of high ones). Players can win by either emptying their hand, capturing all cards, or being first to reach 100 points, creating multiple strategic paths to victory. The game shows high strategic depth, as evidenced by the AI's perfect win rate against random play, meaning skilled players will have a significant advantage over casual ones.

## 3. TimelessMare

**Fitness:** 0.8606
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a highly strategic trick-taking card game where players combine tableau building with traditional trick play. Each turn, players may play up to 5 cards to their tableau (if they have at least 2 cards in hand), participate in a tricks phase with clubs as trump and spades as the breaking suit, and then must play exactly one card to their tableau if their hand exceeds 8 cards. Players win by either scoring under 39 points, emptying their hand, or achieving a state where all hands are empty, creating multiple paths to victory that reward both aggressive play and careful hand management.

The 100% win rate of the strategic AI against random play demonstrates this is a deeply skill-based game where decision-making and planning are crucial for success.

## 4. LightningHound

**Fitness:** 0.8603
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a complex hybrid game that combines tableau-building with traditional trick-taking mechanics using Hearts as trump. Players must strategically manage their tableau size through multiple phases - initially playing up to 8 cards when space is limited, then being forced to play exactly one card when the tableau grows large, before engaging in 13 rounds of trick-taking where low cards win and following suit is mandatory. Victory can be achieved through three different paths: maintaining a low score under 39 points, capturing all tricks, or emptying your hand completely, creating multiple strategic avenues to pursue. The perfect 100% win rate by the strategic AI against random play indicates this is a highly skill-intensive game where careful planning and tactical decision-making are crucial for success.

## 5. OldQueen

**Fitness:** 0.8591
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a hybrid trick-taking and tableau-building game where players start with 22 cards each and must navigate through multiple phases on their turn - first playing a trick where low cards win and hearts can break suit, then optionally playing cards to a tableau when holding 3+ cards, and finally making mandatory tableau plays when their hand exceeds 8 cards. Victory comes from either emptying your hand completely or capturing all available cards through the trick-taking mechanics. The game features an unusual "low card wins" twist on traditional trick-taking and combines this with strategic hand management across multiple play areas, creating a complex decision space where timing and card conservation are crucial - evidenced by the 100% win rate of strategic AI over random play.
