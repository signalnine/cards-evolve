## 1. CarvedSuit

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players draw cards generously (potentially up to 3 per turn) and then must play exactly 2 cards to their tableau, but only when holding more than 2 cards in hand. The goal is to be the first to empty your hand completely, creating a race where players must balance their massive card intake with mandatory plays. The game features an unusual draw-heavy mechanic that ensures players rarely run out of options, making hand management the key strategic element.

## 2. JustSigil

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players take turns drawing cards from the discard pile and deck, then playing cards to a shared tableau in a structured sequence of mandatory actions. The game ends when all players empty their hands or someone reaches 460 points, creating dual paths to victory. What makes this game particularly unique is its rigid turn structure that forces players to both draw and play cards in every turn, creating a fast-paced rhythm where hand management becomes crucial despite the mandatory nature of most actions.

## 3. DashingCall

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players take turns drawing cards from both the deck and discard pile, then have the option to play cards to a shared tableau area if they have at least 3 cards in hand. The game can be won either by emptying your hand completely or by capturing all available cards, creating an interesting tension between shedding and collecting strategies. What makes this game unique is its aggressive card cycling system where players draw 4 cards per turn (2 from deck, 2 from discard), leading to rapidly changing hand compositions and strategic decisions.

## 4. LunarFalcon

**Fitness:** 0.8582

Players take turns drawing cards and playing them to a shared tableau, with each turn featuring an initial draw-and-play sequence followed by two additional card draws and an optional mass play phase (if holding 3+ cards). Victory comes either by being the first to reach 500 points or when all players have emptied their hands completely. The game's unique dual-phase turn structure creates an interesting tension between mandatory early plays and strategic late-turn decisions about whether to dump multiple cards at once.

## 5. FierceDeal

**Fitness:** 0.8582

In this fast-paced card game, players alternate between aggressive card drawing (pulling 2-4 cards per turn) and strategic card placement onto a shared tableau. Each turn requires at least one mandatory play, with optional bonus plays available when holding 3+ cards. The unique rhythm of heavy drawing followed by selective playing creates intense hand management decisions as players race to be the first to empty their entire hand and claim victory.
