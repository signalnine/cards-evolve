## 1. ElderBet

**Fitness:** 0.8541

This is a strategic hand management game where players draw a card each turn and then must play cards to a shared tableau through multiple mandatory and optional play phases, with stricter requirements when holding fewer cards. Players can win by either keeping their score under 109 points, being the first to reach exactly 100 points, or by emptying their hand completely. The game features an interesting tension between aggressive card play and careful hand management, as players face increasingly restrictive play requirements as their hands dwindle, creating multiple viable paths to victory.

Players navigate a unique rhythm of mandatory and optional card plays, starting each turn by playing exactly two cards to the tableau, then having the opportunity to play additional cards if they maintain at least 3 cards in hand. The game features an interesting safety net mechanism where players automatically draw 3 new cards if they empty their hand completely. Victory goes to whoever achieves the lowest score under 73 points, empties their hand first, or survives until all players run out of cards - creating multiple strategic paths to success.

## 4. FeralGambit

**Fitness:** 0.8541

Players navigate a complex turn structure where they must play exactly one card to the tableau, then draw a card, followed by optional opportunities to play up to 10 cards at once if they maintain at least 3 cards in hand. The game features multiple win paths: be the first to empty your hand, keep your score under 69 points, or survive until all players run out of cards. What makes this particularly intriguing is the tension between the mandatory single-card play and the powerful but conditional multi-card dumps, creating strategic decisions about hand management and timing.

## 5. BluntCard

**Fitness:** 0.8541

Players navigate a complex turn structure where they can optionally play up to 10 cards to the tableau when holding 3+ cards, draw a card, then must play exactly one card in a mandatory phase, followed by another optional play phase. The game combines trick-taking mechanics over 13 tricks with dual win conditions - either achieve the lowest score under 100 points or be the first to empty your hand completely. What makes this particularly intriguing is the asymmetric turn phases that create strategic tension between when to conserve cards versus when to aggressively play multiple cards at once.
