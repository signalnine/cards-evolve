## 1. PrimeRing

**Fitness:** 0.8583

This is a fast-paced card game where players alternate between drawing cards and playing single cards to a shared tableau, with each turn involving multiple draw-and-play cycles that rapidly cycle through hands. Victory goes to whoever either empties their hand first or maintains the lowest score under 50 points when the game ends. The unique rhythm of drawing three cards while playing two each turn creates an interesting tension between hand management and racing to go out, as players must balance speed with keeping their scores low.

## 2. CloudRing

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players take turns in a unique four-phase cycle: first optionally playing up to 6 cards to the tableau (but only if it already has more than 3 cards), then drawing 2 cards from the deck, followed by mandatory play of exactly 1 card to the tableau, and finally drawing 2 more cards from the discard pile. The goal is to be the first player to empty your hand completely. The game's distinctive rhythm of conditional optional plays followed by mandatory actions, combined with drawing from both deck and discard pile in the same turn, creates an interesting push-and-pull dynamic between building up resources and managing hand size.

## 3. GildedTrick

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players take turns drawing multiple cards from the deck and strategically playing sets of cards to a shared tableau, with the ability to play more cards when their hand size reaches certain thresholds. Victory is achieved either by emptying all players' hands or by capturing all available cards through tableau play. The game features an unusual triple-draw mechanic each turn and flexible play conditions that create tension between holding cards for better opportunities and playing aggressively to control the shared space.

## 4. SecretBout

**Fitness:** 0.8583

This is a fast-paced card game where players rapidly cycle through cards by drawing 2 cards per turn and playing at least one card to a shared tableau, with an optional second play phase that allows dumping up to 10 cards if you have 3 or more in hand. The goal is simple: be the first player to empty your entire hand of cards. What makes this game unique is its accelerated pace - players draw twice as many cards as they play in the early phases, creating hand management tension before the explosive dump phase allows for dramatic comebacks.

## 5. GreenShield

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players take turns playing cards from their hand to a shared tableau, with a mandatory play of one card followed by an optional burst play of up to 10 cards if they have 3+ cards remaining. After playing, each player draws three new cards from the deck, creating a unique rhythm of hand management and explosive multi-card plays. Victory comes through either emptying your hand completely, being first to reach 100 points, or maintaining the lowest score under 50 - creating multiple strategic paths where players must balance aggressive card dumping with careful scoring optimization.
