## 1. LunarRank

**Fitness:** 0.9354
**MCTS Win Rate:** 0.0%

In this unusual card game, players start with 18 cards and must play exactly one card to the tableau each turn (but only when holding more than 6 cards), followed by an optional draw of 6 new cards from the deck. Victory can be achieved through three different paths: reaching a high score of 186 points, emptying all hands, or capturing all cards through the trick-based mechanics that run alongside the standard play. The game features an intriguing tension between hand management and multiple win conditions, though the 0% MCTS win rate suggests the outcome may be more dependent on luck than strategic decision-making.

## 2. LoudFox

**Fitness:** 0.9354
**MCTS Win Rate:** 0.0%

In this chaotic card game, players start with massive 18-card hands and can draw up to 6 more cards per turn (but only when they already have more than 5 cards), then play up to 10 cards at once to their tableau in a trick-based format. Victory comes from either scoring exactly 181 points or capturing all cards in play, creating multiple paths to success. The game's bizarre mechanics—including the ability to play enormous numbers of cards simultaneously and the paradoxical draw condition—make it so random that even advanced AI strategy performs no better than pure chance, suggesting luck completely dominates over skill.

## 3. WesternCloak

**Fitness:** 0.9354
**MCTS Win Rate:** 0.0%

Players take turns optionally drawing up to 6 cards from the deck, then playing 0-5 cards to a shared tableau area in this trick-based game where each hand consists of 13 tricks. Victory comes from either capturing all cards or reaching a score of 200 points, though the game appears to have some balancing issues. Interestingly, the strategic AI performed poorly against random play, suggesting the game mechanics may favor luck over skill or contain some exploitable patterns that make optimal play counterproductive.

## 4. FirstTemple

**Fitness:** 0.9354
**MCTS Win Rate:** 2.0%

Players alternate drawing up to 6 cards and playing cards to a shared tableau in trick-based rounds, but can only play when holding at least 3 cards in hand. Victory comes through either capturing all cards or reaching a high score of 172 points across the game's 13 tricks per hand. The game appears heavily luck-dependent rather than skill-based, as advanced AI strategy performs no better than random play, suggesting the optional draw phase and restrictive play conditions create a game driven more by card distribution than tactical decisions.

## 5. ProwlingClash

**Fitness:** 0.9354
**MCTS Win Rate:** 2.0%

Players take turns drawing up to 7 cards and then playing up to 10 cards to a shared tableau (limited to 6 cards maximum), creating a hybrid between traditional card play and trick-taking mechanics over 13 rounds. Victory comes through emptying your hand, reaching 200 points, or capturing all cards from opponents. The game appears heavily luck-based rather than strategic, as evidenced by advanced AI performing poorly against random play, suggesting the optional draw and play phases create more chaos than meaningful decision-making.
