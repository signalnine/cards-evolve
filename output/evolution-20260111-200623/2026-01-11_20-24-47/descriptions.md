Players engage in trick-taking rounds where they must follow suit when possible, with spades as trump and hearts as the breaking suit, but with a chaotic twist—playing sevens forces all opponents to draw 2 cards while sixes reverse the turn order. Victory comes through either maintaining a low score under 11, racing to exactly 50 points, or surviving until 95 points in this endurance-based scoring system. The moderate strategy depth (66% MCTS win rate) means tactical play matters, but the wild card effects and multiple win conditions create unpredictable swings that keep even skilled players on their toes.

This is a strategic trick-taking game where players follow suit and try to win tricks with spades as trump, but with a twist - nines force all opponents to discard a card while sixes make opponents draw two cards, creating dynamic hand management challenges. Players can win by either scoring very low (under 10), very high (over 100), or by capturing the most tricks, offering multiple viable strategies. The 70% win rate of advanced AI against random play indicates this is a skill-intensive game where strategic thinking and careful card management significantly impact success.
