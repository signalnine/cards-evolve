## 1. GildedShuffle

**Fitness:** 0.8582

Players alternate between drawing cards and playing them to a central tableau, with a unique twist: if you empty your hand completely, you get a bonus draw of 3 cards to keep you in the game. The goal is to be the first to permanently empty your hand of all 15 starting cards. What makes this game particularly engaging is its conditional play phases - you can only play cards when you have at least 3 in hand initially, but later phases force mandatory plays when you have more than 1 card, creating strategic tension between holding cards and managing your hand size.

## 3. AzureWood

**Fitness:** 0.8582

Players take turns drawing cards and playing them one at a time to a shared tableau, with an interesting twist: if you empty your hand completely, you get to draw 3 bonus cards to keep going. The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards from your starting hand of 12. What makes this game unique is its "second wind" mechanic that rewards aggressive play - running out of cards isn't a penalty but actually gives you more options to continue playing.

## 4. TwinMeadow

**Fitness:** 0.8581

Players take turns drawing three cards from the deck, then have the option to play up to 10 cards to their tableau if they have at least 3 cards in hand, followed by a mandatory play of exactly 1 card if they have more than 1 card remaining. The goal is to be the first player to empty their entire hand of cards. What makes this game unique is its asymmetric turn structure that combines generous card drawing with flexible optional plays followed by forced single-card plays, creating interesting hand management decisions.

## 5. CleverMare

**Fitness:** 0.8581

Players take turns drawing three cards from the deck, then have two opportunities to play up to 10 cards to a shared tableau - but only if they have at least 3 cards in hand. The goal is to be the first to empty your hand completely, creating a race to shed cards while managing the minimum hand size requirement for playing. This creates an interesting tension where players must balance aggressive card play with maintaining enough cards to continue making plays in future turns.
