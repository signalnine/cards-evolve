## 1. FadedBastion

**Fitness:** 0.8267

Players engage in trick-taking rounds where they must follow suit and avoid Hearts (similar to Hearts), but with an unusual twist: after each trick, they draw three cards - one from the deck, one from the discard pile, and another from the deck - before optionally playing cards to a shared tableau area. Victory goes to the player with the lowest score under 100 points, or whoever empties their hand first in this hybrid format. The game's most distinctive feature is its heavy card flow, with players constantly cycling through cards via the triple-draw mechanism, creating a dynamic balance between traditional trick-avoidance and hand management.

## 2. CosmicRaid

**Fitness:** 0.8223

Players engage in trick-taking rounds where they must follow suit and compete to win tricks, but with an unusual twist: after each trick, they draw cards from both the deck and discard pile, then can optionally play cards to a shared tableau if they have enough cards in hand. The goal is to achieve the lowest score under 100 points or be the first to empty your hand completely. The most intriguing aspect is the hybrid nature that combines traditional trick-taking with hand management and tableau building, creating tension between winning tricks and managing your card count.

## 3. QuickBout

**Fitness:** 0.8219

Players engage in trick-taking rounds where they must follow suit (with hearts as the breaking suit), then draw cards from the discard pile and potentially from the deck based on various conditions before playing a card to the tableau if they have more than 3 cards in hand. Victory can be achieved through three different paths: maintaining the lowest score under 100 points, being first to reach exactly 47 points, or being the first to empty your hand completely. The game's most intriguing feature is its complex multi-phase turn structure that combines traditional trick-taking with conditional card drawing and strategic hand management across potentially hundreds of turns.

## 4. BlessedWall

**Fitness:** 0.8218

Players engage in trick-taking rounds where they must follow suit and play high cards to win tricks, but with a twist: after each trick, they draw from the discard pile and can optionally draw additional cards from the deck under certain conditions. The goal is to achieve the lowest score while staying under 115 points, though players can also win by being first to reach 50 points or by emptying all hands completely. What makes this game unique is its hybrid nature - combining traditional trick-taking with tableau play and multiple draw phases that create dynamic hand management decisions throughout each round.

## 5. MistMoor

**Fitness:** 0.8217

Players engage in traditional trick-taking where they must follow the lead suit (with hearts as the breaking suit), then draw from the discard pile and potentially from the deck if they have no valid plays remaining. After the trick phase, players can optionally play cards to a shared tableau if they have at least 3 cards in hand, followed by another mandatory draw from the discard pile. The game ends when either a player reaches 100 points or all players empty their hands, creating an interesting hybrid between classic trick-taking and tableau-building mechanics.
