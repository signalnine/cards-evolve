The game features chaotic special effects triggered by specific card ranks, including Jacks that grant extra turns, Queens that force discards while giving opponents extra turns, and Fives that reverse play direction, creating a highly strategic experience where advanced planning significantly outperforms random play.

This is a trick-taking card game with a chaotic twist, where players must follow suit when leading but low cards win tricks instead of high ones. Each card rank triggers powerful special effects when played - Jacks give opponents extra turns, Threes skip turns, and Aces force card draws - creating a tactical puzzle of when to play which cards. Players can win by either capturing all tricks, having the best hand, or emptying their hand first, and the high MCTS win rate (96%) indicates that skillful play and forward planning significantly outweigh luck in navigating the card effects.

The game features powerful special effects triggered by face cards and aces that can dramatically alter gameplay by forcing opponents to draw extra cards, discard, or skip turns, creating a highly skill-intensive experience where strategic planning significantly outperforms random play.
