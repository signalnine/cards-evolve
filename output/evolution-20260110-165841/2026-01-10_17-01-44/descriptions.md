**Fitness:** 0.8567

Players draw three cards each turn, then have the option to play multiple cards to a shared tableau if they have at least 3 cards in hand, followed by a mandatory play of exactly one card. The goal is to be the first to empty your hand completely, creating a strategic tension between when to hold cards for optional plays versus being forced to discard. The unique double-draw followed by conditional group play mechanic makes hand management crucial, as players must balance building up cards for big plays while avoiding getting stuck with too many cards.

**Fitness:** 0.8562

This is a fast-paced hand management game where players begin each turn by drawing three cards from the deck, then must play exactly one card to the shared tableau. Players can optionally play additional cards (up to 10) to the tableau, but only if they have at least 3 cards in hand. The first player to empty their hand completely wins the game, creating an exciting race as hands rapidly cycle between filling up and being played down.

## 4. KeenDome

**Fitness:** 0.8560

Players take turns drawing three cards from the deck, then have the option to play cards to a shared tableau if they have at least 3 cards in hand, followed by a mandatory play of exactly one card (if they have more than one card remaining). The goal is to be the first player to empty your hand completely, creating a race to shed cards while managing the balance between optional strategic plays and forced single-card discards. The game's unique rhythm of heavy card drawing followed by mixed optional and mandatory playing creates interesting hand management decisions as players must carefully time when to make their big tableau plays.

## 5. WiseLance

**Fitness:** 0.8559

Players begin each turn by drawing a card, then may optionally play any number of cards to a shared tableau if they have at least 3 cards in hand, followed by drawing two more cards and being forced to play exactly one card to the tableau. The goal is to be the first player to empty your hand completely, creating a strategic tension between the optional bulk-play phase and the mandatory single-card play that ends each turn. The unique dual-phase structure encourages players to carefully manage their hand size, as having fewer than 3 cards restricts your playing options significantly.
