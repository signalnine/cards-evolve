## 1. ModernRaid

**Fitness:** 0.8580

Players draw three cards each turn and then have two opportunities to play cards from their hand to a shared tableau, but only when holding at least three cards. The goal is to be the first to empty your hand completely. The unique rhythm of multiple draws followed by conditional play phases creates an interesting tension between accumulating cards and finding the right moments to shed them.

## 3. HighStone

**Fitness:** 0.8579

Players experience a unique rhythm of drawing and playing cards, where each turn consists of drawing a card, optionally playing up to 10 cards to the tableau (but only if they have 3+ cards in hand), drawing again, making a mandatory single-card play, and drawing once more. The goal is to be the first to empty your hand completely, creating an interesting tension between the optional mass-play opportunity and the forced single-card plays. The game's distinctive multi-draw, multi-play turn structure creates strategic decisions about when to hold cards for the big plays versus when to conserve for the mandatory phases.

## 4. NightElk

**Fitness:** 0.8579

Players take turns with optional tableau-building phases where they can play 0-10 cards from their hand (but only when holding 3+ cards), followed by drawing 3 new cards from the deck each turn. The goal is to be the first player to empty your hand completely, creating a race to play cards faster than you draw them. What makes this game unique is the escalating hand management challenge - players must strategically balance when to play cards versus when to hold them, as the mandatory 3-card draw each turn constantly refills their hands.

## 5. TwinAce

**Fitness:** 0.8579

Players take turns playing exactly one card from their hand to a shared tableau, with a unique twist: they draw 3 new cards only when their hand drops to exactly 1 card remaining. The goal is to either empty all hands completely or achieve the lowest score under 91 points, creating an intriguing balance between hand management and strategic card placement. This evolved game features an unusual conditional draw mechanic that forces players to carefully time their plays, as they can't simply draw cards whenever they want.
