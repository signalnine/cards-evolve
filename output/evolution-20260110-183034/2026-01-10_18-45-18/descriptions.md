## 1. WiseTower

**Fitness:** 0.8558

Players take turns drawing up to 5 cards from the deck and must play exactly one card to the tableau whenever their hand grows beyond 8 cards, creating a strategic balance between hand management and forced plays. Victory can be achieved in multiple ways: being the first to reach 50 points, emptying all hands, or maintaining the lowest score under 200 points. The game features an intriguing trick-based structure with 13 tricks per hand, but combines this with tableau play rather than traditional trick-taking, creating a unique hybrid mechanic.

## 2. EternalGambit

**Fitness:** 0.8555

Players take turns drawing up to 6 cards from the deck and then playing cards to a shared tableau, but can only play when they have at least 3 cards in hand. The game features multiple paths to victory: be the first to empty your hand completely, reach 122 points, or achieve the ultimate goal of 500 points. What makes this particularly intriguing is the tension between the generous card draw that fills your hand and the restriction that limits when you can actually play cards, creating strategic decisions about when to hold back versus when to make your move.

## 3. SteelCrown

**Fitness:** 0.8553

Players begin each turn by optionally drawing up to 6 cards from the deck, then can play 0-10 cards to the tableau (but only if they have at least 3 cards in hand). Victory comes through capturing all cards, emptying everyone's hands, or being first to reach 117 points in this trick-based game that blends traditional card play with massive hand management - allowing players to potentially hold huge numbers of cards while making strategic decisions about when and how many to play.

## 4. LustrousBond

**Fitness:** 0.8552

Players draw up to 6 cards from the deck and can play multiple cards to a shared tableau, but only when holding at least 3 cards in hand. The game combines trick-taking elements with a race to either empty all hands or be the first to score 113 points across 13 tricks per round. What makes this particularly intriguing is the optional massive card draws and the strategic tension between playing cards freely versus maintaining the minimum hand size required to make plays.

## 5. LunarSea

**Fitness:** 0.8550

In this strategic hand management game, players must carefully play cards to a central tableau, but only when their hand size exceeds specific thresholds - first when holding more than 6 cards, then when holding more than 7 cards. Players can optionally draw 2 additional cards each turn, creating tension between building hand size to enable plays and managing resources effectively. The game ends when all players empty their hands or someone reaches 100 points, with the unique twist that mandatory plays are gated behind hand size requirements rather than traditional card matching rules.
