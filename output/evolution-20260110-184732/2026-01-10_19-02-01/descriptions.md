## 1. GlidingHelm

**Fitness:** 0.8583

Players draw up to 6 cards each turn, then must play exactly one card to a central tableau (but only if they have more than 2 cards in hand). The game ends when either all players empty their hands or someone reaches 113 points, creating an interesting tension between going out quickly versus accumulating points. The optional draw mechanic combined with the hand-size restriction creates strategic decisions about when to take cards versus when to focus on playing out.

## 2. StoneBow

**Fitness:** 0.8581

Players draw up to 5 cards each turn and must play exactly one card to the tableau when their hand exceeds 8 cards, creating a trick-based structure over 13 rounds. Victory can be achieved through three different paths: being the first to score 50 points, emptying all hands, or maintaining the lowest score under 200 points. The game's unique tension comes from the forced hand-size management combined with multiple competing win conditions, creating strategic depth as players must balance offensive scoring with defensive hand control.

## 3. RoyalRing

**Fitness:** 0.8579

In this trick-based game, players start with 7 cards and can optionally draw up to 6 more cards each turn, then play 0-10 cards to the tableau (though they can only play if they have at least 3 cards in hand). Victory comes through capturing all cards, emptying everyone's hands, or being first to reach 116 points across the game's 13 tricks per hand. The most intriguing aspect is the flexible card management system that lets players dramatically expand their hand size while having complete control over how many cards to play each turn.

## 4. AstralHelm

**Fitness:** 0.8577

Players take turns drawing up to 6 cards and playing 1-8 cards to a shared tableau, but only when the tableau has 3 or fewer cards already placed. The game blends trick-taking elements with multiple win paths - players can victory by emptying all hands, being first to reach 122 points, or having the highest score above 51 points. The unique aspect is the tableau size restriction that creates strategic timing decisions about when to play cards, combined with the flexibility of optional draws and variable card plays.

## 5. VoidHand

**Fitness:** 0.8575

Players draw up to 6 cards each turn and can play multiple cards to a shared tableau, but only when holding at least 3 cards in hand. The game ends when all players empty their hands or when someone reaches 117 points, creating an interesting tension between playing cards quickly and maintaining hand size for valid plays. This evolved design uniquely combines trick-taking mechanics with flexible card play limits, forcing players to balance aggressive emptying strategies against the minimum hand requirement.
