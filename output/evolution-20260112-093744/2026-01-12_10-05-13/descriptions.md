Players engage in 13 rounds of trick-taking where they play cards to win tricks, but with a chaotic twist - whenever someone plays a Six, the next player must discard 2 cards and the turn order reverses. Victory comes from either emptying your hand, keeping your score below 100 points, or surviving until all hands are empty. The game rewards strategic thinking over pure luck, as demonstrated by AI players significantly outperforming random play, though there's still plenty of unpredictability from the Six cards' disruptive effects.

Players engage in betting rounds followed by trick-taking gameplay, where they must carefully manage their 14-card hands while navigating disruptive special effects triggered by Tens and Sixes that force opponents to discard cards. Victory comes through either maintaining a low score below 10 points, capturing all available tricks, or simply capturing the most tricks overall. The moderate skill ceiling (68% MCTS win rate) suggests that while strategic play matters, the combination of betting, forced discards, and multiple win paths creates enough chaos to keep games unpredictable and engaging for players of different skill levels.

The game features clever twist cards - Sixes force opponents to discard two cards while Fives reverse the play direction - and the moderate MCTS success rate (61%) suggests that while strategy matters, luck and timing play significant roles in determining the outcome.

Players combine betting and trick-taking in this high-stakes 4-player game, where each turn begins with a betting phase (minimum 65 chips) followed by playing cards to win tricks without suit restrictions. Victory comes from either scoring extremely low (10 points or less), capturing all tricks, or simply capturing the most tricks among all players. The game features a unique twist where playing a Six skips the next player's turns and forces all opponents to discard cards, creating chaotic disruption, though the moderate skill factor suggests luck plays a significant role alongside strategy.

This is a trick-taking game where players compete in 13 rounds of card play followed by betting phases, with special cards that force opponents to discard from their hands - Twos make the next player discard 2 cards, while Sixes force all opponents to discard 1 card each. Players can win by keeping their score below 10 points, capturing all available cards, or simply capturing the most cards overall. The game rewards strategic thinking significantly, as evidenced by advanced AI achieving a 74% win rate against random play, though there's a notable first-player advantage that adds an interesting positional element to the competition.
