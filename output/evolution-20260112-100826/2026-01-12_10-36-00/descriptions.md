This is a chaotic trick-based card game where players start with 14 cards and must draw 5 cards from the discard pile each turn before playing tricks. Victory comes from either emptying your hand, keeping your score below 10, or pushing your score above 66 - creating multiple competing strategies. The game features disruptive special cards (Fours force all opponents to discard, Sixes skip everyone's next turn, and Queens target specific players), but the 0% skill differential suggests the heavy randomness from mandatory discard pile draws overwhelms any strategic decision-making.

This is a trick-taking card game where players start with 17 cards and participate in betting rounds before playing 13 tricks, with sixes creating chaos by forcing opponents to discard cards and reversing play direction. Victory comes from achieving a low score under 10 points, though there are alternative win conditions at 500 and 515 points that create interesting strategic tension. The game appears to be largely luck-based with minimal strategic depth, as advanced AI players perform no better than random play, making it more of a gambling-style social experience than a skill-intensive card game.

This trick-taking game combines poker-style betting with card play, where players start with hefty chip stacks (842 chips) and must make substantial minimum bets (65 chips) each round while playing through 13 tricks. Players can win by achieving either a very low score (under 10), emptying their hand completely, or reaching a high score of 78, creating multiple strategic paths to victory. The game features chaotic special effects where playing a Six reverses the turn order and playing a Two forces all opponents to draw extra cards, though ironically the complexity seems to create a purely luck-based experience where skilled play offers no advantage over random moves.

Players engage in trick-taking gameplay where they must follow the lead suit (unless unable), with Spades as the permanent trump suit that beats all other cards. Victory comes from either emptying your hand, keeping your score below 10 points, or being the last player standing when all hands are empty. Special cards add tactical depth - playing a Six forces the next player to discard 2 cards, while Jacks give all opponents an extra card, and the 68% win rate of strategic AI over random play shows that skillful card management and timing make a real difference.

Players engage in a high-stakes trick-taking game where each turn begins with mandatory betting (minimum 65 chips) followed by playing cards to win tricks, with special cards creating chaos - Fives force opponents to discard cards while Tens reverse the play direction. Victory comes from achieving either extremely low scores (under 10) or high scores (around 500), creating tension between conservative and aggressive strategies. With a 69% win rate for advanced AI versus random play, this game rewards tactical thinking and careful chip management, though the significant first-player advantage suggests turn order plays a crucial role in success.
