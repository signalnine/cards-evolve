In this strategic two-player card game, players start with 10 cards each and take turns playing cards to a shared tableau, but only when exactly 6 cards are already present - creating a unique timing puzzle where players must wait for the perfect moment to make their move. Victory comes from being the first to empty your hand completely, though the game can also end when both players run out of cards simultaneously. The high MCTS success rate (100% vs random play) reveals this is a deeply strategic game where skilled players can consistently outmaneuver novices, likely by controlling the tableau size and timing their plays optimally.
