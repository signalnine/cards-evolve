## 1. BraveHoldfast

**Fitness:** 0.8669

Players take turns drawing cards from either the discard pile or deck, then must play at least one card to the tableau, with the option to play additional cards if they have 3+ cards in hand. The game can end when all players empty their hands, when someone reaches 100 points, or through a low-score victory at 106 points - creating multiple competing strategies. What makes this game unique is its flexible draw system that lets players choose between deck and discard pile draws, combined with the tension between going out quickly versus managing score thresholds.

## 2. RacingPlain

**Fitness:** 0.8668

Players navigate a complex turn sequence where they can optionally draw cards from the deck, play cards to a shared tableau when they have 3+ cards in hand, potentially draw from the discard pile, and must make mandatory plays when holding too many cards. The game combines trick-taking mechanics with multiple win paths - players can victory by capturing all available cards, emptying everyone's hands, or maintaining the lowest score under 106 points. What makes this game particularly intriguing is its unusual rhythm of optional and mandatory actions that create a "racing" dynamic where hand management becomes crucial as players balance between different winning strategies.

## 3. LightningDeck

**Fitness:** 0.8666

Players navigate a complex turn structure where they can draw up to 4 cards from the discard pile and 2 from the deck, then play cards to a shared tableau under varying conditions - sometimes freely when holding 3+ cards, sometimes forced to play exactly one card when their hand exceeds 6 cards. Victory comes through either capturing all cards, emptying everyone's hands, or maintaining the lowest score under 88 points across the game's 13 trick-taking rounds. The game's most intriguing feature is its adaptive play requirements that shift based on hand size, creating a strategic tension between hoarding cards and being forced into mandatory plays.

## 4. LightningGambit

**Fitness:** 0.8663

Players navigate a complex multi-phase turn system where they can optionally draw cards from both the deck and discard pile, then play cards to a central tableau under varying conditions - sometimes freely when holding 3+ cards, sometimes mandatory single-card plays when their hand exceeds 7 cards. Victory comes through either capturing all cards, emptying everyone's hands, or maintaining the lowest score under 106 points across 13 trick-taking rounds. The game's most intriguing feature is its massive card cycling potential, where players can draw up to 8 cards per turn (2 from deck, 6 from discard) while managing strict hand-size restrictions that force strategic plays.

## 5. RustedMare

**Fitness:** 0.8663

Players take turns drawing cards from either the deck or discard pile, then playing cards to a shared tableau when they have at least 3 cards in hand - with the twist that they can potentially play up to 10 cards at once and get multiple opportunities to play per turn. Victory comes from either capturing all cards, emptying everyone's hands, or maintaining the lowest score under 106 points across what can be an extremely long game lasting up to 345 turns. The game's most distinctive feature is its hybrid nature, combining trick-taking elements with tableau building and offering players unusual flexibility in both drawing and playing cards.
