This is a chaotic 4-player trick-taking game where players start with 12 cards and must navigate betting rounds with mandatory minimum bets of 56 chips before each trick. Players can win by having the best poker hand, emptying their hand completely, or reaching a score of 82 points, creating multiple viable strategies. The game features wild Six cards that reverse turn order and force all opponents to draw 3 additional cards, adding a significant element of disruption and luck that makes strategic planning nearly impossible - as evidenced by the 0% skill differential between advanced AI and random play.

Players compete in a trick-taking card game where each turn involves a betting phase with mandatory minimum bets of 65 chips and up to 2 raises per round, followed by playing cards to win tricks over 13 rounds. Victory can be achieved through three different paths: maintaining a low score under 10 points, emptying your hand completely, or being first to reach 458 points. The game features a unique twist where playing a Six card reverses the turn direction, and despite the betting mechanics, the 0% skill differential suggests outcomes are largely determined by luck rather than strategic play.

In this 4-player card game, players take turns making claims about having 1-3 cards of sequential ranks (like "I have 7-8-9"), which opponents can challenge to catch bluffs. Special cards add chaos - Tens force the next player to discard a card, while Sixes make all opponents discard two cards each. Victory comes from reaching exactly 10 or 82 points, or being the last player with cards remaining, creating an unusual scoring dynamic where both very low and very high scores can win. The game appears to rely heavily on luck rather than strategic skill, making it more about reading opponents and timing than deep planning.

This is a chaotic 4-player trick-taking game where players start with substantial chip stacks (1,172) and must place bets each round before playing their 13 tricks. Players can win by achieving either a very low score (under 10), emptying their hand completely, or reaching a high score of 82 points. The game features wild "six" cards that create mayhem by forcing the next player to discard cards and reversing the turn order, making it nearly impossible to develop consistent strategies - as evidenced by the 0% skill differential between advanced AI and random play.

This trick-taking game combines classic card play with poker-style betting, where players compete in 13 tricks per hand followed by betting rounds with raises capped at 2. Victory comes from achieving either a very low score (10 points), emptying your hand completely, or reaching a high score of 82 points, creating multiple strategic paths to win. The game features a unique twist where playing any Six forces the next player to discard 2 cards and reverses play direction, adding tactical disruption to standard trick-taking, and the strong MCTS performance (67% vs random) indicates that skillful play and strategic thinking significantly impact success.
