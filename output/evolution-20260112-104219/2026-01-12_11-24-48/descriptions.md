Players engage in a chaotic trick-based card game where they can only play cards when their hand size drops below 2, creating a unique constraint on traditional card play. Victory can be achieved through multiple paths: having the best hand, emptying your hand completely, or being first to reach 638 points. The game features wild special effects triggered by specific ranks - Sevens force opponents to discard, Eights can give extra turns or skip players, and Kings devastate opponents by forcing them to discard 3 cards, making this more about surviving the chaos than deep strategy.

This is a trick-taking game where players follow suit and play cards to win tricks, but with a twist - low cards beat high cards instead of the traditional hierarchy. Players aim to either empty their hand or keep their score below 84 points to win. What makes this game particularly chaotic is the abundance of special card effects: Jacks give extra turns, Threes skip opponents, Twos and Queens force discards, Aces make opponents draw cards, and Kings cause mass discarding - creating a highly interactive experience where every card played can dramatically alter the game state. With MCTS achieving a 96% win rate against random play, strategic thinking and careful card management are essential for success.

This is a strategic two-player card game that combines trick-taking with tableau building, where players can either play cards to a shared tableau (limited to 8 cards) or engage in traditional trick-taking with diamonds as trump and a twist where low cards beat high cards. Players win by achieving the lowest score under 78 points, getting the best hand, or emptying their hand completely. The game features powerful special effect cards that can drastically alter gameplay - Jacks give extra turns, Threes skip opponents, and Aces both force card draws and grant additional turns, creating a highly strategic experience where advanced planning significantly outperforms random play.

This is a strategic trick-taking game where players must carefully manage their hand size by playing cards to a shared tableau (only when holding fewer than 4 cards), then compete in traditional trick-taking rounds with spades as trump. Victory comes through achieving the lowest score, having the best hand, or emptying your hand first, while special card effects create tactical disruption - Jacks give opponents extra turns, Threes skip turns, and Aces/Twos/Queens force card draws or discards. With a 100% MCTS win rate against random play, this game heavily rewards strategic thinking and careful timing of when to trigger the powerful special effects that can dramatically swing momentum between players.

This is a strategic trick-taking game where players lead with suits (following diamonds as trump and spades as the breaking suit) while managing special card effects that can force opponents to discard, draw extra cards, or even grant bonus turns. Players can win by either emptying their hand, achieving the best final hand, or being first to reach 638 points across multiple rounds. The game features a fascinating blend of traditional trick-taking with chaotic special abilities triggered by sevens, tens, aces, eights, and fours, and the 100% MCTS win rate against random play indicates that skilled strategic thinking provides a significant advantage despite the card effects adding unpredictability.
