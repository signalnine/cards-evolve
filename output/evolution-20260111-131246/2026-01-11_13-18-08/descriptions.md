Players engage in a tactical card management game where they must carefully play cards to their tableau based on shifting conditions - sometimes forced to play when their hand is nearly empty (fewer than 3 cards) or when holding too many cards (9 or more), with additional opportunities based on tableau size and hand count. Victory comes from either achieving a low score under 73 points or completely emptying your hand first. The game rewards strategic thinking and forward planning, as evidenced by the high skill differential where advanced AI strategies significantly outperform random play, making every decision about when and how many cards to play critically important.

Players engage in a complex multi-phase card game where they must strategically play cards to a shared tableau based on their current hand size - playing 1-7 cards when they have fewer than 7 cards, then potentially playing up to 4 more cards if they have more than 2 remaining. Victory can be achieved through multiple paths: emptying your hand first, waiting for all hands to be empty, or having the best remaining hand when the game ends. The game rewards deep strategic thinking, as evidenced by advanced AI achieving a 98% win rate against random play, while the unusual hand-size-dependent play restrictions and multiple win conditions create intricate tactical decisions that can dramatically shift throughout the match.

Players must first play 1-2 cards to their tableau when holding more than 5 cards, then may optionally add another card if their tableau has 10 or fewer cards, before engaging in trick-taking rounds where low cards win instead of high cards. Victory comes through either emptying your hand, keeping your score below 83 points, or being first to reach 500 points - creating multiple strategic paths to win. The high MCTS success rate (98%) indicates this is a deeply strategic game where skillful play significantly outperforms random moves, and the second player actually has a notable advantage over the first player.

This is a hybrid card game that combines tableau building with trick-taking mechanics, where players must play 1-2 cards to a shared tableau when their hand size exceeds 8 cards, then engage in traditional trick-taking rounds with Hearts as trump.

The game features an unusual multi-phase turn structure that blends shedding and trick-taking elements, and with a 98% MCTS win rate against random play, strategic decision-making is crucial for success.
