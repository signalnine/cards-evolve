**Fitness:** 0.8602
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a strategic trick-taking game where players must carefully manage their hand size while playing cards to a shared tableau and competing in traditional tricks where low cards win and spades can break suit requirements. Players can win by emptying their hand first, reaching a score of 141 points, or having the best hand composition at game's end. The game features a unique mandatory play requirement when holding more than 6 cards, creating interesting hand management decisions, and the 100% MCTS win rate indicates that strategic planning and careful card play significantly outweigh luck.

## 2. OldLock

**Fitness:** 0.8598
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a sophisticated hybrid game that combines traditional trick-taking with tableau building, where players must follow suit in Hearts-trump tricks while also strategically playing cards to a shared tableau area based on its current size. Victory comes from either emptying your hand or capturing all available cards, creating multiple strategic paths to win. The game features an intriguing multi-phase turn structure that evolves as the tableau grows, and with MCTS achieving a perfect 100% win rate against random play, strategic thinking and careful planning are absolutely essential for success.

## 3. SolarQueen

**Fitness:** 0.8580
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a strategic tableau-building game where players navigate through multiple conditional play phases each turn, carefully managing when and how many cards they can play based on their hand size and tableau state. Players win by emptying their hand completely, but must skillfully balance building their tableau (which unlocks certain plays) while maintaining the right hand size to trigger mandatory play requirements. The game features a unique cascading phase system where different conditions activate different mandatory plays, creating deep strategic decisions - evidenced by the 100% win rate of strategic play against random moves, making this a highly skill-dependent game.

## 4. VividVault

**Fitness:** 0.8577
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

This is a highly strategic trick-taking game where players must follow suit when leading, but with a twist: Hearts are trump and low cards actually win tricks instead of high ones. After each trick, players go through tableau-building phases where they can optionally play cards if they have 3+ in hand, then must play 1-3 cards if their tableau already has at least 3 cards. Players can win by emptying their hand, capturing all cards, or being the last with cards remaining, creating multiple strategic paths to victory.

The 100% MCTS win rate against random play indicates this is a deeply skill-intensive game where strategic decision-making in both trick-taking and tableau management is crucial for success.

**Fitness:** 0.8576
**MCTS Win Rate:** 100.0%

Players engage in a tactical tableau-building game where they must carefully manage their card plays across multiple phases each turn, with strict restrictions on how many cards can be placed based on the current tableau size. The goal is to empty your hand while keeping your score below 200 points, creating a delicate balance between aggressive play and point management. The game features an unusual multi-phase turn structure with some mandatory plays, and the 100% MCTS win rate against random play indicates that strategic decision-making is crucial for success.
