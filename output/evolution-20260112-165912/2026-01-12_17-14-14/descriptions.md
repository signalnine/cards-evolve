This is a trick-taking card game where 4 players compete to win tricks by following suit and playing the highest card, but with a chaotic twist - whenever someone plays a Jack or Ten, the play direction reverses. Players aim to achieve the lowest score possible (under 12 points) while emptying their hands over 13 tricks, with Hearts serving as a special suit that can "break" normal play rules. The moderate AI performance (53% vs random) suggests some strategic depth, though the high first-player advantage and direction-changing mechanics add significant unpredictability to what would otherwise be a standard trick-taking format.

This is a trick-taking game where four players compete over 13 rounds, following suit when possible with spades as trump, but with a twist - playing certain cards triggers disruptive effects like forcing opponents to discard or skip multiple turns. Players can win through multiple paths: maintaining a low score under 13 points, capturing the most tricks, or achieving the best hand composition. The game offers meaningful strategic depth, as evidenced by AI players significantly outperforming random play, though a notable first-player advantage suggests the turn order creates some imbalance in competitive opportunities.

| Session Length | 0.044 |

This is a trick-taking game where 4 players compete over 13 tricks per hand, with spades as trump and a requirement to follow the lead suit when possible. Players can win by achieving a low score of 12 or less, having the best hand, or emptying their hand completely, while special cards add tactical complexity - eights skip the next player's turn and jacks force opponents to draw 3 cards. The moderate strategy depth (63% MCTS win rate) combined with multiple win conditions and disruptive special effects creates an engaging blend of traditional trick-taking with modern card game mechanics, though there's a notable advantage to going first.

**Skill Evaluation:**
- Greedy vs Random: 40.0%
- MCTS vs Random: 59.0%
- Combined Skill Score: 0.49

| Rules Complexity | 0.925 |
| Skill vs Luck | 0.479 |
| Bluffing Depth | 0.000 |
| Session Length | 0.045 |

This is a trick-taking game where 4 players compete over 13 tricks per hand, with spades as trump and hearts as the breaking suit, but with chaotic special card effects that can skip opponents' turns (fives) or reverse play direction (jacks). Players win by achieving the lowest score under 13 points, having the best hand, or staying under 500 points across multiple hands. The moderate skill ceiling (59% MCTS win rate) suggests that while strategy matters, the disruptive special effects and significant first-player advantage (+27%) introduce enough chaos to keep games unpredictable and exciting for players of different skill levels.

This is a trick-taking game where players must follow the lead suit if possible, with spades as trump and hearts as the breaking suit, but with a twist - eights cause the next player to skip their turn, while aces force the next player to draw 3 additional cards. Players win by either scoring 13 or fewer points, emptying all hands, or capturing the most tricks, creating multiple strategic paths to victory. With a 59% MCTS win rate against random play, there's meaningful strategic depth as players must balance traditional trick-taking tactics with the disruptive special card effects.
