This is a chaotic 4-player trick-taking game where players must follow suit with spades as trump, but special card ranks trigger disruptive effects like forcing opponents to discard, skip turns, or draw extra cards. Players can win by achieving a low score under 79 points, having the best hand, or emptying their hand completely. The moderate strategy element (56% MCTS win rate) suggests that while tactical play matters, the numerous special effects create enough unpredictability to keep games exciting and prevent any single approach from dominating.
